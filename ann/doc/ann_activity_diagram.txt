Training ANN with Stochastic Gradient Descent
'/

(*)--> "Randomly initialize the weights to small numbers close to 0 but not 0"
--> "Input the first observation of your dataset in the input layer, each feature in one node"
--> [from left to right]"Forward-Propagation: Propagate the activations until getting the predicted value"
--> "Compare the predicted vs actual result-measure the generated error(Cost function)." 
--> [from right to left]"Back-Propagation: Update the weights based on their contribution to the error."
--> "Repeat step-1 to 5 and update the weights after each observation(Reinforcement Learning)" 
--> "When the whole training set passed through the ANN, that makes and epoch. Redo more epochs"
