Software Design for Artifical Neural Network example.

Will start out with the snap shot of an Artifical Neural Network solution.  The appllication reads the hand 
writen digit training data and label data.  It utilized it utilizes the ANN algorithem using a combination
of Linear Algerbra, Stochastic Gradient Descent, forward and backward propogation.  It saves the weights 
and biases in  a json formated file.  

Use case are produced as a result of human interaction with the software solution.  There are many scenarios.
this will allow to tell the story deschipering classes and their relation, class diagrams, and sequence flow.

    1.  The Data_Enginineer runs Hand_Writen_Recognition on the data file and visualized the numerical values.

    2.  The user runs the solution to train the algorithem and saves the weights and biases to a json formated file.

    usecase "recognize hand writen numbers" as UC3
    /'
    3.  The user runs the solution with an input file to recognize the hand writen digit.
